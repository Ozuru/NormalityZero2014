# Normality Zero's 2014 Aerial Assist Robot Code

## who

This code is my baby.

## what

This is simply a repository containing the rewritten code for our robot from 2014's challenge of Aerial Assist. 

## why

The programming laptop used for the majority of the programming was stolen and a neither suitable nor recent backup could be found. I'm a fan of keeping robots from the previous years alive and running so I chose to rewrite the code, this time in command-based rather than iterative.
